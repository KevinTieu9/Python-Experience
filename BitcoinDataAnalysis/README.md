Project 2: Data Analysist Project

In Project 2, I’ll be building on the data I’ve collected using Project 1. For this example, I will be collecting all of the available data from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/ and put all available data into a CSV. I’ll be using either Seaborn (on top of matplotlib) and/or Pandas to create a line extending from the day the market data was first collected until the most recent (of the CSV file.) and implement linear regression by unloading the data I collected from the csv file into plots.
